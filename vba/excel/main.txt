VBA is an object-oriented programming language
Many of Excel’s objects belong to collections.

Worksheets("MySheet").Select == This is an example of collection


Sub procedures: A set of programming instructions that performs some
action. All recorded macros will be Sub procedures.

Function procedures: A set of programming instructions that returns a
single value (similar in concept to a worksheet function, such as Sum)

A single VBA module can store any number of Sub procedures, Function
procedures, and declarations. How you organize a VBA module is completely up
to you. Some people prefer to keep all their VBA code for an application in a
single VBA module; others like to split up the code into several different
modules. It’s a personal choice, just like arranging furniture.
